        <h4>How do I know how much I have made from engaging on the app?</h4>
        <p>For now, we are yet to integrate that into the app because it is an app still in progress. So earnings will be communicated through the official WhatsApp on the 25th of every month while the withdrawals are automatically done within a week after that.</p>
        <h4>How do I withdraw from the platform?</h4>
        <p>There is no need to apply for a withdrawal. Immediately after your earnings balance has been sent to your WhatsApp, you will be asked to provide the mode of payment you want. Basically, we take only ByBit UID, Opay, Kuda and Access Bank. Any banm outside this will require a fee of #50 that will be removed from your balance.</p>
